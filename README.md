# BVW_Round2
 
This is the two-week project I made for BVW course at CMU ETC. It took microphone and webcam as inputs. Players would be playing as a vampire in the game. They would use their head to navigate around, open their mouths to attack humen, and use their voice to cast magic spells to transform into bats.

## My contribution to this project
#### Movement controller with webcam 

#### Simple human AI with NavMesh

#### User Interface

#### Worked with artists to add models and set up environment
